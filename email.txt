Subject: Interested in joining hostel
Respected sir/madam of MVBS hostel,

I got your contact through a friend, and I'm really interested in joining the hostel. 
I live in a small village buti-bori located in outskirts of Nagpur city,
and would love to have the opportunity to experience living in MVBS hostel,

i think I am good fit for hostel in sweet and simple word i am a "good boy" and as this year itself i have got 
college through online cap process through mht cet with rank (5976), and as i am new to this city i don't 
have any friends and any relative that can allow me to live in there home and as i belong to middle class family 
with monthly income of only 20k it is very difficult for my father to pay pg rent located in mumbai
as after asking many pg owner there price it was around 11k-12k per month which is to high,for my family

my short term goal is to build my own game development company as soon as possible because gaming industry 
is going boom in future and its right time to do it , and my long term goal is to take that company to
top of all company which currently many games in India.

So, 
this are my goal and why I am interested in joining this hostel is because I can afford it.

I would like to know if there is any availability for me before I go ahead and make any plans.

Your faithful,
hostel finder

Thank you.
